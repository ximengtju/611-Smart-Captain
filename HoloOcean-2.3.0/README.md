HoloOcean is a high-fidelity simulator developed by the [Field Robotic Systems Lab (FRoStLab)](https://frostlab.byu.edu) at [Brigham Young University](https://byu.edu).

Built upon Unreal Engine (by Epic Games) and Holodeck (developed by the BYU PCCL Lab), HoloOcean enables easy simulation of marine robotics and autonomy with a wide variety of sensors, agents, and features.

## HoloOcean 2.3.0 New Features
 - Raycast and Semantic Raycast Lidar
 - Depth Camera
 - Semantic Segmentation Camera
 - New Business Campus Package

 # HoloOcean 2.2.2 Features
 - Underwater currents 
 - Biomass, salinity, and temperature (BST) sensor
 - Tide control
 - Environment appearance with weather and time of day commands
 - Vehicle flashlights

## Features
 - 3+ rich worlds with various infrastructure for generating data or testing underwater algorithms
 - Complete with common underwater sensors including DVL, IMU, optical camera, various sonar, depth sensor, and more
 - Highly and easily configurable sensors and missions
 - Multi-agent missions, including optical and acoustic communications
 - Novel sonar simulation framework for simulating imaging, profiling, sidescan, and echosounder sonars
 - Imaging sonar implementation includes realistic noise modeling for small sim-2-real gap
 - Easy installation and simple, OpenAI Gym-like Python interface
 - High performance - simulation speeds of up to 2x real time are possible. Performance penalty only for what you need
 - Run headless or watch your agents learn
 - ROS 2 integration
 - High-fidelity Fossen vehicle dynamics
 - Linux and Windows support

## Upcoming Features

Semantic segmentation camera, semantic LiDAR sensor, and depth camera coming soon for HoloOcean 2.3.

## Installation

## Usage Overview
HoloOcean's interface is similar to OpenAI's gym.

We try and provide a batteries included approach to let you jump right into using HoloOcean, with minimal fiddling required.

To demonstrate, here is a quick example using the `Ocean` package:

```python
import holoocean

# Load the environment. This environment contains a hovering AUV in a pier
env = holoocean.make("PierHarbor-Hovering")

# You must call `.reset()` on a newly created environment before ticking/stepping it
env.reset()                         

# The AUV takes commands for each thruster
command = [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10]   

for i in range(30):
    state = env.step(command)  
```

- `state`: dict of sensor name to the sensor's value (nparray).

If you want to access the data of a specific sensor, import sensors and retrieve the correct value from the state dictionary:

```python
print(state["DVLSensor"])
```
